# Comparison of machine learning algorithms in predicting missing data in exoplanet survey
## Abstract
In the search of other habitable planets, weâ€™ve recently started to collect exoplanetary data. In order to make educated decisions about which planets to dedicate more research and attention to, scientists need data that is of high quality. Most of the data available to us currently, however, contains mistakes and missing values. To alleviate this problem, we need to spend more effort researching efficient ways to improve the quality of our data. This paper will focus on comparing different machine learning (ML) approaches on their efficacy in predicting missing exoplanetary data. This will be done by predicting said data and evaluating how well the different models perform based on accuracy. The results will then be analysed and some insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the algorithms will be given. Finally, a conclusion will be given about which algorithms perform well and what improvements could be done to the predictive algorithm.
